Final Project Reflection: Lessons, Growth, and Execution
By Sylvia Elliott
Throughout this course, I found myself challenged in all the right ways. From the first module to this final epic project, 
I experienced what it truly means to apply software engineering principles in a real-world, collaborative setting. This final assignment especially felt like a culmination of everything we tackled 
— from clean code and version control to testing, Docker, authentication, and collaborative debugging.
The “User Profile Management” feature was the primary responsibility. I implemented an API route that allowed authorized users (Managers/Admins) to upgrade a user to professional status. 
This involved designing and integrating the upgrade_to_professional method in the service layer, updating the Pydantic schema, adjusting the database model, and creating a secure, protected endpoint. 
It also meant writing extensive tests, including those for validation errors, permission denials, successful upgrades, and refactoring until they all passed. It was far from easy, but incredibly rewarding.
Along the way, I learned how critical test-driven development and clear logging are for tracking down bugs. One error — a simple Pydantic validation mismatch — taught me more about model serialization than a full week of lectures. 
I also gained practical experience with Docker-based deployments, PostgreSQL integration, and CI/CD practices using GitHub Actions.
Most importantly, I learned how to stay focused and self-reliant when the problems kept piling up. There were moments I genuinely thought I broke the project. But through logs, unit tests, research, and a lot of persistence, 
I found ways to fix things cleanly and professionally. Every test passed in the end — and that felt like a graduation moment in itself.
I am far from perfect as this was one of my first classes in informational science/data science, but I am confident that with your resources and advice I will do just fine.
Thank you for this course. It was tough, but we prevailed — and I walk away feeling like an almost real software engineer.
