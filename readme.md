# FastAPI User Management System

This project implements a secure and robust REST API using FastAPI and PostgreSQL, designed for managing users with full CRUD operations, role-based access control (RBAC), and OAuth2 authentication.

Through this assignment, I gained a deeper understanding of:
- FastAPI
- Pydantic v2
- OAuth2 password flow
- Writing robust unit and integration tests using Pytest and `pytest-asyncio`
- Schema validation strategies and `model_dump` vs `model_validate`
- Token-based authentication edge cases
- HATEOAS-style API response links

One of the more challenging aspects was aligning raw SQLAlchemy ORM objects with Pydantic V2 models, especially when creating structured `UserResponse` outputs. I also became much more comfortable debugging token parsing issues, field mismatches, and role-based access control logic.

This project helped me build cleaner test coverage (90%+), structure tests with reusable fixtures, and mock complex components like email verification using `mock_smtp`. I also learned to manage Docker services and CI coverage more fluently.

## ðŸš€ New Feature: Upgrade User to Professional

We added a secure endpoint that allows **Admins and Managers** to upgrade any user to a professional account:

**Route:** `POST /users/{user_id}/upgrade`  
**Logic:** 
- Only users with `ADMIN` or `MANAGER` roles may invoke this
- Internally uses `UserService.upgrade_to_professional()`
- Includes full test coverage for success, insufficient role, and non-existent user edge cases

âœ… This feature was tested via:
- `test_upgrade_user_to_professional_success`
- `test_upgrade_user_to_professional_forbidden`
- `test_upgrade_to_professional_user_not_found`
- `test_upgrade_to_professional_insufficient_role`
